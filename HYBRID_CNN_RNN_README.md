# Hybrid CNN-RNN Architecture for Seismic Waveform Inversion

A comprehensive deep learning implementation for Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) using a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture specifically designed for the OpenFWI dataset.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Why Hybrid CNN-RNN?

**Seismic data has both spatial and temporal structure:**
- **Temporal**: Wave propagation through time (1000 time steps)
- **Spatial**: Receiver arrays and geological structures (70√ó70 velocity models)

**Our hybrid approach:**
1. **RNN Component**: Processes temporal sequences to extract wave propagation patterns
2. **CNN Component**: Processes spatial receiver arrays to extract geological structures
3. **Fusion Module**: Combines multi-source information using attention mechanisms

## üß† Model Architecture Details

### Temporal Encoder (RNN Component)

```python
class TemporalEncoder(nn.Module):
    - Bidirectional LSTM (2 layers, 64 hidden units)
    - Multi-head attention (8 heads)
    - Processes each seismic trace through time
    - Extracts: first breaks, wave arrivals, amplitude patterns
```

**Why LSTM?**
- Captures temporal dependencies in wave propagation
- Bidirectional processing sees both early and late arrivals
- Attention focuses on important time steps (first breaks, reflections)

### Spatial Encoder (CNN Component)

```python
class SpatialEncoder(nn.Module):
    - Multi-scale 1D convolutions (kernels: 3, 5, 7)
    - Spatial attention mechanism
    - Processes receiver arrays for each source
    - Extracts: coherent arrivals, velocity gradients, geological boundaries
```

**Why CNN?**
- Detects spatial patterns across receiver arrays
- Multi-scale kernels capture different geological features
- Translation invariant (same feature detected anywhere)

### Source Fusion Module

```python
class SourceFusionModule(nn.Module):
    - Multi-head attention across 5 sources
    - Learns optimal combination of source information
    - Handles varying source-receiver geometries
```

### Velocity Decoder

```python
class VelocityDecoder(nn.Module):
    - Transpose convolutions for upsampling
    - Skip connections preserve fine details
    - Generates 70√ó70 velocity models
```

## üî¨ Physics-Informed Loss Functions

### 1. Basic MSE Loss
```python
mse_loss = MSE(predicted_velocity, target_velocity)
```

### 2. Smoothness Regularization
```python
# Penalizes unrealistic velocity variations
smoothness_loss = ||‚àávelocity||¬≤
```

### 3. Gradient Preservation
```python
# Ensures structural features are preserved
gradient_loss = MSE(‚àápredicted, ‚àátarget)
```

### 4. Geological Realism
```python
# Enforces realistic velocity ranges and depth trends
geological_loss = depth_penalty + range_penalty
```

### 5. Travel Time Consistency
```python
# Ensures predictions are consistent with seismic arrivals
travel_time_loss = consistency_check(velocity, seismic_data)
```

## üìä Training Strategy

### Progressive Training Schedule

1. **Simple Phase** (20 epochs): FlatVel families only
   - Learn basic layered velocity structures
   - Establish fundamental wave propagation patterns

2. **Intermediate Phase** (15 epochs): Add Style families
   - Introduce geological complexity
   - Learn structural variations

3. **Complex Phase** (15 epochs): Add Fault families
   - Handle lateral heterogeneity
   - Learn fault detection and characterization

4. **Full Phase** (10 epochs): All families
   - Final refinement on complete dataset
   - Robust generalization

### Data Augmentation

- **Noise Addition**: Realistic SNR levels
- **Time Shifting**: Simulate timing uncertainties
- **Amplitude Scaling**: Account for acquisition variations
- **Receiver Dropout**: Handle missing data

## üìà Expected Performance

Based on the data analysis, the model should achieve:

- **RMSE**: < 200 m/s (typical seismic inversion accuracy)
- **Relative Error**: < 10% for most velocity ranges
- **Structural Similarity**: > 0.8 correlation with true models
- **Inference Time**: ~50ms per sample (GPU)

    output_size=(70, 70)         # Match your velocity grid
)
```

### Loss Function Weights

```python
# Adjust physics constraints
criterion = PhysicsInformedLoss(
    mse_weight=1.0,           # Basic accuracy
    smoothness_weight=0.2,    # Increase for smoother models
